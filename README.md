  In "madlib" I learned how to take user inputs and output them into my printed strings. 3/9/21

  In "how long until 100" I learned that I need to convert numbers into integers in order to do math with them, and then convert those numbers into strings so that they can be printed properly. 3/9/21

  In "caluculator" I used simple if/elif/else statements to practice taking user inputs to do simple math. 3/11/21

  In "dictionary" I learned how to create key value pairs and set them into a dictionary to pull months of the year based on 3 letter codes. I also learned how to apply .get in order to print a message when invalid keys are used. 3/11/21

  In "while loop" I very simply applied the while loop structure to a number to carry out a brief sequence of addition. 3/11/21

  In "guessing game" I applies a combination of booleans, while loops, and if statements to create a 3 guess mini game to find a secret word. (It's not a very fun game to play, but making it sure was.) 3/11/21

  In "what year were you born" I practiced my if statements by creating a short program that asks how old you are and calculates what year you were born. It can correct itself by asking a follow up question of one year earlier with a tweaked equation. (This is to account for people who already had their birthday this year!) 3/12/2021

  In "for loop" I learned how to apply the function to create a sequence of "loves me, loves me not, loves me" (like the flower petal game) in a range of numbers. ( I arbitrarily picked 307) I applied one condition for every odd number and the other for evens. I also learned how to use # to add notes to my programs! 3/12/21

  In "2d lists" I learned how to format multiple lists together and then print out specific values/indexes based on their location in the subset of lists. 3/15/2021

  In "appending files" I learned how to use the .write function to append information directly into the file. 3/15/2021

  In "reading files" I learned how to use the open function as well and several different versions of .read in order to pull and print various lines from the text file. 3/15/2021

  In "writing files" I learned how to use .write to created a new text file. 3/15/2021

  In "exponent function" I learned how to program a function that will for loop a range of numbers in order to take a input value to the exponent of a second value. 3/15/2021

  In "nested loop" I learned how to use a nested for loop inside of another for loop to print out each value separately in a set of lists, rather than just printing the whole lists together. 3/15/2021

In "student" and "classes" I learned how to create a class and define values for objects, and then how to import them into a separate file to be used in a program. 3/16/2021

In "question" and "multiple choice quiz" I used a class to establish what the questions would include. Then I imported that class, applied arrays to a function, and used for loops and an if statement to ask each question and add points to the score before printing out the results. 3/16/2021 
  In "try except" I learned how to use the try/except functions to run a program that will give a specific output if a certain error is made. 3/15/2021

  In "translator" I learned how to create a function that combines for loops and if statements to see if a user's input contains specific characters(in this case I used vowels) and change those inputs out with a different character(x) set in the program. This results in a print out of the "translation" of the test language. 3/15/2021

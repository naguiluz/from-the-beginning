In "how long until 100" I learned that I need to convert numbers into integers in order to do math with them, and then convert those numbers into strings so that they can be printed properly. 3/9/21

In "caluculator" I used simple if/elif/else statements to practice taking user inputs to do simple math. 3/11/21

In "while loop" I very simply applied the while loop structure to a number to carry out a brief sequence of addition. 3/11/21

In "guessing game" I applies a combination of booleans, while loops, and if statements to create a 3 guess mini game to find a secret word. (It's not a very fun game to play, but making it sure was.) 3/11/21

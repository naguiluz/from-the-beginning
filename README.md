In "madlib" I learned how to take user inputs and output them into my printed strings.

In "how long until 100" I learned that I need to convert numbers into integers in order to do math with them, and then convert those numbers into strings so that they can be printed properly.

In "caluculator" I used simple if/elif/else statements to practice taking user inputs to do simple math.

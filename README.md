In "madlib" I learned how to take user inputs and output them into my printed strings.

In "how long until 100" I learned that I need to convert numbers into integers in order to do math with them, and then convert those numbers into strings so that they can be printed properly.

In "caluculator" I used simple if/elif/else statements to practice taking user inputs to do simple math.

In "dictionary" I learned how to create key value pairs and set them into a dictionary to pull months of the year based on 3 letter codes. I also learned how to apply .get in order to print a message when invalid keys are used. 

In "while loop" I very simply applied the while loop structure to a number to carry out a brief sequence of addition.

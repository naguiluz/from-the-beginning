In "madlib" I learned how to take user inputs and output them into my printed strings. 3/9/21

In "how long until 100" I learned that I need to convert numbers into integers in order to do math with them, and then convert those numbers into strings so that they can be printed properly. 3/9/21

In "caluculator" I used simple if/elif/else statements to practice taking user inputs to do simple math. 3/11/21

In "dictionary" I learned how to create key value pairs and set them into a dictionary to pull months of the year based on 3 letter codes. I also learned how to apply .get in order to print a message when invalid keys are used. 3/11/21

In "while loop" I very simply applied the while loop structure to a number to carry out a brief sequence of addition. 3/11/21

In "guessing game" I applies a combination of booleans, while loops, and if statements to create a 3 guess mini game to find a secret word. (It's not a very fun game to play, but making it sure was.) 3/11/21
In "what year were you born" I practiced my if statements by creating a short program that asks how old you are and calculates what year you were born. It can correct itself by asking a follow up question of one year earlier with a tweaked equation. (This is to account for people who already had their birthday this year!) 3/12/2021
